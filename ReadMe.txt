I make 3 types of Messenger.
1st one just sends messages between 2 terminals without using any outer server or smack.
2nd one uses them and i tried to use java but it didn't work, most probably I downloaded wrong library. I submitted it because I was working on it for a week and did not want it to disappear.
3rd one is python version it fully works.
